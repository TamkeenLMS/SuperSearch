# What is Super Search
It's a simple one-page html file you can use to make a multiple-website Google search! You can group websites into `Channels`, then you can select the "Channel" you want to search in the websites listed in it.

It will simply open Google Search in a new tab with the search query you provided and add the `site:[website] OR ...` segment for each website in the targeted channel. Dead simple but very useful!

## Adding a new Channel

Add as many channels as you want, these information will be saved to the browser's local storage, so the next time you will open the SuperSearch.html file you will find the channels you provided before.

## Search
simply pick the channel then enter your query, then click "Search",
